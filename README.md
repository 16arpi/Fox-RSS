# Fox RSS

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project isn't maintened for now. I don't turn it into an archive because I still want to improve the app, but I don't know when I'll come back to its development.

Fox RSS is a simple rss reader which allows you to create a selection of articles to read later. The application is available [on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pigeoff.rss) in english and french.

Fox RSS is a free and open source android application.

## How to use it

An complete introduction is available [there in english](https://pigeoff.pw/fox/help/en/) and [there in french](https://pigeoff.pw/fox/help/fr/).

### Add rss feeds

There are two ways to add a rss feed. The first one is to manually add the url of the rss feed. Go in the tab "RSS Feeds" and click on the "+" button. Add the url there. The second way is to share a website from you favorite web browser. When sharing it, choose Fox RSS as destination app. Fox RSS will recognize automatically the rss feed if it exists.

### Do your selection

In the first tab, drag the articles you want to the right and the ones you don't want to the left. By doing so, you're makng your selection of articles to read later. All of them are available in the tab "Selection". Unread articles will stay there indefinitely, whereas read articles will vanish after a specific time chosen in the settings (or one week by default).

When you click on an article (in the swipe view or the selection view), a reader will open to let you read it. You can also open the article in your web browser from the reader view.

### See all the articles of a rss feed

If you want, you can have access to all the articles of a specific rss feed by clicking on it in the "RSS Feeds" tab.

## Contribution

I'm currently working alone on this project and because of my studies and my brass band üé∫üë®‚Äçüéì, I don't have enough time to fully develop nice new features. So if you like the app and have android development skills, please consider joining the project ! Here some features users already requested :

- [x] dark mode
- [ ] more customisation choices (for the reader view and the articles selection)
- [ ] .opml import
- [ ] RSS database explorer
- [ ] import rss feeds from online services (ex: Feedly, the Old Reader etc.)
- [ ] clean the code (I'm still a student, it lacks of order, methodology and algorithm efficency)
- [ ] anything you consider worth to add !
